# Traitify Widgets

## Installing and Initializing The Library

The widgets can be installed through our CDN or npm. Usage through the CDN will maintain backwards compatibility, while the npm library will use semantic versioning.

### CDN

```
<script src="https://cdn.traitify.com/js/v2/traitify.js"></script>
<script>
  Traitify.setHost("your host url");
  Traitify.setPublicKey("your public key");

  assessment = Traitify.ui.component();
  assessment.assessmentID("an assessment id you have generated via a server side client");
  assessment.target("#the-id-of-the-target-you-wish-to-render-to");
  assessment.render();
</script>
```

### npm

#### Installation

```
npm i --save traitify-widgets
```

#### Usage

```
import traitify from "traitify-widgets";

assessment = traitify.ui.component();
assessment.assessmentID("an assessment id you have generated via a server side client");
assessment.target("#the-id-of-the-target-you-wish-to-render-to");
assessment.render();
```

### Additional Career Component Customizations

#### Add content to the Career Filter

  context.customContent.appendChild(document.createTextNode("I am custom content"));
});
```

#### Add content to the Career Modal

#### Trigger a refresh of the career results with different params

```
// Update parameters and re-request careers
Traitify.ui.trigger("Careers.mergeParams", this, {experienceLevels: [4, 5], page: 1});
```

#### Get your careers from a different endpoint

This is useful if you want to get the career results server side and modify the data returned or just want to proxy through your own server.

```
Traitify.ui.options.careerOptions.path = "/my-career-endpoint";
```

#### Change which experience levels are in the filter

```
assessment.render("Guide"); // Given an assessmentID with results, render just the Interview in the target element
```

### Render multiple components in specific elements

```
assessment.targets({
  "SlideDeck": "#slide-deck",
  "PersonalityTypes": "#personality-types",
  "PersonalityTraits": "#personality-traits",
  "Results": "#results",

Here is a list of the available locales (`en-us` is the default):
  - Chinese - `zh-cn`

### Render a back button to allow users to change answers during the test

```
assessment.allowFullscreen();
```

### Allow the user to view section results section headers

```
assessment.allowHeaders();
```

### Render results using specific perspective

\* currently only the `big-five` assessment has perspective content

OR

assessment.perspective("thirdPerson");
```

## Reports

Set the perspective and view options to display our Big Five Personality Reports.

### Big Five Hiring Manager Report

```
assessment.perspective("thirdPerson");
assessment.view("manager");
```

This report also makes use of a benchmark/recommendation. It will default to the benchmark used to create an assessment. To use a different benchmark, you can pass the ID as an option.

```
assessment.benchmarkID(benchmarkID);
```

### Big Five Candidate Report

```
assessment.perspective("firstPerson");
assessment.view("candidate");
```

### Engage Employee Report

```
assessment.perspective("thirdPerson");
assessment.view("employee");
```

## Traitify Client

We expose our JavaScript api client that you can use to make additional calls to our API from the client side. We make available `get`, `put`, and `post` functions. These methods will use the api key and url you configured when you initialized the Traitify library. Here is an example that returns career matches for a `career-deck` assessment. Further documentation on the API methods available can be found at https://app.traitify.com/developer/documentation.

```
<script src="https://cdn.traitify.com/js/v2/traitify.js"></script>
<script>
  Traitify.setHost("your host url");
  Traitify.setPublicKey("your public key");
  var assessmentId = "an assessment id you have generated via a server side client";
  Traitify.get("/assessments/" + assessmentId + "/matches/careers").then(function(career_matches){
    console.log(career_matches);
  });
</script>
```
