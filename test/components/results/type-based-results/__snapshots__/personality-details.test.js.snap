      You often find yourself working with other Naturalists as you try to work outdoors as much as possible and find your like-minded colleagues alongside you.  You also enjoy working with other Analyzers whose shared cerebral interests find you having many things in common. You appreciate your Planner colleagues as well.  They take care of managing the details so you can think through the big picture of a project and then get started on it right away.

      You are versatile because while you have your own work preferences, you work well with all types of people.  You appreciate the leadership of Visionaries and the helping hand a Mentor is always willing to provide.  However, you may find it challenging to share a workspace with your Inventor colleagues.  Their creative process can often lead to a chaotic work process and environment, which doesn't always jive with your thoughtful yet reserved approach.
