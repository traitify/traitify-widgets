The benefits of being open-minded are likely to include approaching problems in original ways, making quick connections, pushing boundaries, seeing the bigger picture, and not getting stuck in the detail.
In contrast someone who is pragmatic likes to solve problems in practical ways, and prefers tried-andtested solutions or established rules and regulations.
They are likely to have a fine eye for detail, be results oriented, and able to bring experience to bear on a problem.
Those who are a mixture of both (openminded/pragmatic) are best described as approaching problems in a systematic way, being able to flex between different options, capable of seeing situations at different levels of detail, and as bringing healthy caution to decision making.
These personality characteristics provide the basis for asking a particular sequence of questions of each of the personality 'types'.

The level of self-discipline, dedication, orderliness and reliability are all hallmarks of the organized person.
The benefits of being focused are likely to include obvious things like creating a structure for work and being task focused; but also having a pride in doing a job well, paying attention over the long term, and being disciplined even when work is routine or 'boring'.
In contrast someone who is flexible probably prefers to approach tasks in a dynamic manner, quickly reacting to things as they occur, side-stepping anything that isn't of personal interest, in order to achieve rapid results.

The benefits of being open-minded are likely to include approaching problems in original ways, making quick connections, pushing boundaries, seeing the bigger picture, and not getting stuck in the detail.
In contrast someone who is pragmatic likes to solve problems in practical ways, and prefers tried-andtested solutions or established rules and regulations.
They are likely to have a fine eye for detail, be results oriented, and able to bring experience to bear on a problem.
Those who are a mixture of both (openminded/pragmatic) are best described as approaching problems in a systematic way, being able to flex between different options, capable of seeing situations at different levels of detail, and as bringing healthy caution to decision making.

The level of self-discipline, dedication, orderliness and reliability are all hallmarks of the organized person.
The benefits of being focused are likely to include obvious things like creating a structure for work and being task focused; but also having a pride in doing a job well, paying attention over the long term, and being disciplined even when work is routine or 'boring'.
In contrast someone who is flexible probably prefers to approach tasks in a dynamic manner, quickly reacting to things as they occur, side-stepping anything that isn't of personal interest, in order to achieve rapid results.
Those who are a mixture of both (focused/flexible) are best described as able to focus on the process and the goal, and allocating their energies in a measured way while continually reviewing what needs to be done next.
These personality characteristics provide the basis for asking a particular sequence of questions of each of the personality 'types'.

They are likely to have a fine eye for detail, be results oriented, and able to bring experience to bear on a problem.

The benefits of being extraverted are likely to include being people oriented, approachable, fun loving, energetic, fast to act, and 'full on'. In contrast someone who is introverted probably prefers to work independently, and is more likely to be dispassionate, thoughtful and measured, to think before acting and to stand back. Those who are a mixture of both (extroverted/introverted) are best described as socially skilled, quick to connect, energetic, thoughtful and action oriented, and enthusiastic.
These personality characteristics provide the basis for asking a particular sequence of questions of each of the personality 'types'. The first question is looking to confirm what they should be like; the second two explore areas of possible concern.",

The benefits of being agreeable are likely to include accommodating other people's points of view, tuning into their particular wavelength, starting from a position of trust, being non-confrontational, and steadily working towards harmonious outcomes.
In contrast someone who is independent will probably be questioning and challenge assumptions, will speak their mind, be competitive, and try and influence others in a direct and impersonal manner.
Those who are a mixture of both (agreeable/independent) are best described as natural negotiators, as they will take a realistic view of others, but will also adopt a relational style and search for a 'win-win' outcome.
These personality characteristics provide the basis for asking a particular sequence of questions of each of the personality 'types'.
The first question is looking to confirm what they should be like; the second two explore areas of possible concern.",

The level of self-discipline, dedication, orderliness and reliability are all hallmarks of the organized person.
The benefits of being focused are likely to include obvious things like creating a structure for work and being task focused; but also having a pride in doing a job well, paying attention over the long term, and being disciplined even when work is routine or 'boring'.
In contrast someone who is flexible probably prefers to approach tasks in a dynamic manner, quickly reacting to things as they occur, side-stepping anything that isn't of personal interest, in order to achieve rapid results.
Those who are a mixture of both (focused/flexible) are best described as able to focus on the process and the goal, and allocating their energies in a measured way while continually reviewing what needs to be done next.
These personality characteristics provide the basis for asking a particular sequence of questions of each of the personality 'types'.
The first question is looking to confirm what they should be like; the second two explore areas of possible concern.",

The benefits of being open-minded are likely to include approaching problems in original ways, making quick connections, pushing boundaries, seeing the bigger picture, and not getting stuck in the detail.
In contrast someone who is pragmatic likes to solve problems in practical ways, and prefers tried-andtested solutions or established rules and regulations.
They are likely to have a fine eye for detail, be results oriented, and able to bring experience to bear on a problem.
Those who are a mixture of both (openminded/pragmatic) are best described as approaching problems in a systematic way, being able to flex between different options, capable of seeing situations at different levels of detail, and as bringing healthy caution to decision making.
These personality characteristics provide the basis for asking a particular sequence of questions of each of the personality 'types'.
The first question is looking to confirm what they should be like; the second two explore areas of possible concern.",

Therefore, when they deal with other people, they will search for a mutually acceptable outcome, because they know ultimately that we all need to work together. In this way, they are probably able to be direct, but are also able to temper their approach with sensitivity for what will keep relationships healthy and intact.",

      "introduction": "At the top level, Managing Pressure (ES) concerns the manner in which someone deals with pressure, and the way in which they control their emotions and underlying tension in order to stay on task and cope with everyday challenges.
The benefits of being resilient are likely to include remaining calm in difficult situations, quickly getting over criticism, keeping feelings under control, and not being easily discouraged.
In contrast someone who is reflexive will probably be more of a worrier, but also highly tuned in to the world; likely to take things to heart but be able to use tension to drive their work forward.
They are also likely to be attuned to other people's emotional states.
Those who are a mixture of both (resilient/reflexive) are best described as even tempered but responsive, realistic about criticism, able to actively manage their feelings, and to cope with most eventualities.
These personality characteristics provide the basis for asking a particular sequence of questions of each of the personality 'types'.
The first question is looking to confirm what they should be like; the second two explore areas of possible concern.",
