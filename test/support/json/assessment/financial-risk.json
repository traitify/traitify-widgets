Prone to an often pessimistic view, any downturn in the portfolio may be attributed to their own poor decisions, and taken as an indication of an inability to make more successful choices in the future. These clients will tend to focus on any unfavorable data points more than on positive ones. In making decisions, structure should be put in place to ensure that decisions are made and actions undertaken, as these individuals are often those who procrastinate, particularly when the necessary task is couched in the emotions of influential decisions."
